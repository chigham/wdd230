            <h2>Site Name: "Gaithersburg Chamber of Commerse (NOT REAL)</h2>
            <p>There is already a real Gaithersburg/Germantown Chamber of Commerse. I can use that website to gain some inspiration, but try not to plagarize. I include (NOT REAL) because my website is just that: not real. In our false example, my website would represent an organization in the Gaithersburg, Maryland, US area. If it was available and I had the money, I would choose the domain name "gaithersburgchamberofcommerse-fake.org".</p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to support business owners in Gaithersburg, especially for startups and other small businesses. It will provide information about who and how to contact within the chamber, relevant policies and legislation for/against which the chamber lobbies, a checklist for entrepeneurs, how to donate to the chamber, chamber events, etc.</p>

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm new to Gaithersburg, where I am starting a new branch in my company. I want to get familiar with the community. What can I learn about my new customers' needs and the legal environment so we can be the most effective?</li>
                <li>I created an awesome new software solution. I'd like to monetize that, but I don't know how to start a business. Where do I start?</li>
                <li>I'd like to get involved in my community here in Gaithersburg. Is there a regularly scheduled local board meeting I could attend?</li>
                <li>I'm a freaking billionaire and I just sold off all my stocks and properties. What business-friendly organization in Gaithersburg is worthy of my cash?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>I like these three colors: <span id="dark-liver">Dark Liver</span>, <span id="dark-olive-green">Dark Olive Green</span>, and <span id="cream">Cream</span>. Dark Liver will be a great sidebar background, Dark Olive Green will be the heading background, and Cream for the nav and footer backgrounds.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The font should be professional, easy to read, and not distracting. Therefore, I chose 2 sans-serif fonts that will do the trick: Roboto for headings and Lato for most everything else. Should anything change, I might include a pretty font for quotes, but that has not yet been determined.</p>
